/**
 * At-boot polyfill audit (development builds only).
 *
 * Lists the globals the libp2p / Optimystic stack reads and reports each as
 * `native`, `polyfilled` (one of polyfills/* patched it — see registry.js), `gap`
 * (known absent, documented, nothing on the phone's paths reaches it), or `MISSING`
 * (absent and unexplained). Anything MISSING gets a loud warning, because that is
 * the shape of every runtime defect this directory exists to prevent: an API the
 * bundle assumes, silently undefined, surfacing minutes later as an unrelated
 * timeout.
 *
 * index.js imports this module between the polyfills and `expo-router/entry`, so
 * the table prints before the router evaluates the app tree (cadre-phone.ts →
 * @libp2p/*). A call placed in index.js's own module body would run after those
 * imports had already evaluated — and an import-time crash from a missing global
 * would beat it to the log.
 *
 * The probe list is deliberately NOT shared with
 * packages/reference-app-ns/src/polyfills/audit.ts. The two runtimes have genuinely
 * different surfaces — that one probes `AbortController` itself, which React Native
 * provides and NativeScript does not, and it probes `BroadcastChannel`, which the
 * NativeScript app needs and this one provably never loads (see
 * docs/reference-app-rn.md § Key Dependencies). A shared list would be a list of
 * per-runtime exceptions and harder to read than two short ones.
 *
 * ADOPTED from sereus/packages/reference-app-rn/polyfills/audit.js. This copy
 * differs in exactly two ways, both sanctioned by the note above: the log label
 * names this app, and RTCPeerConnection is a documented gap rather than a probe,
 * because chat adopts no webrtc polyfill and configures no WebRTC transport.
 * Re-copy from the reference when it changes, then reapply those two.
 *
 * Logs go to console.log / console.warn, which logcat shows as `I/ReactNativeJS`
 * and `W/ReactNativeJS`.
